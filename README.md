# Stock Price Prediction

This project is a Data Science course project implemented in R, focused on predicting future prices of Bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500 index. It employs two different time-series analysis techniques: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and BSTS (Bayesian Structural Time Series).

## Contents

1. **Time-Series Analysis**: We conduct a comprehensive time-series analysis on the historical price movements of Bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500 index. These two assets represent distinct financial instruments with unique characteristics, allowing for a diverse exploration of predictive modeling techniques.

2. **ARIMA Model**: We construct an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, a widely-used statistical technique for forecasting future trends in time-series data. ARIMA models are particularly effective in capturing patterns and seasonality within the data, making them well-suited for stock price prediction.

3. **BSTS Model**: Additionally, we build a Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model, a flexible and modular approach to time-series analysis. BSTS models incorporate prior knowledge and handle uncertainty associated with price volatility, providing a robust framework for forecasting financial asset prices.

4. **Implementation Details**: The complete implementation details, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, are provided in the Jupyter Notebook file (`stock_price_prediction.ipynb`).

5. **Usage**: To run the project locally, you'll need to have R and the required packages installed. Simply open the `stock_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions provided therein.

6. **Contributions**: Contributions to improve the project are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for any bugs, enhancements, or additional features you'd like to suggest.

By leveraging both ARIMA and BSTS models, this project aims to provide accurate and reliable predictions for the future prices of Bitcoin and the S&P 500 index, enabling informed decision-making for investors and traders.
